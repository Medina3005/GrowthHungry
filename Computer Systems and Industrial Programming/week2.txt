Terminal

Terminal is an app that lets you communicate with your operating system using a command-line interface (CLI).
You enter commands and scripts (called shell scripts) to perform tasks on your computer.
Two other terms you might hear with the terminal:
Shell
A shell is the program you interact with when running commands in a terminal.
For Linux, it’s most likely Bash.
For newer macOS versions, it’s Zsh.
For Windows, it’s PowerShell.
These shells differ in their features, but they share most basic commands.
Command-Line Interface (CLI)
A CLI is a program designed to run inside a shell within the terminal.


| Command            | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pwd`              | Print the path of the current directory          |
| `mkdir FOLDERPATH` | Create a new directory                           |
| `touch FILEPATH`   | Create a new file                                |
| `clear`            | Clear the terminal window                        |
| `ls`               | List the contents of a folder                    |
| `ls -al`           | List all contents of a folder with detailed info |
| `cat TARGET`       | Show the content of TARGET                       |



| Command               | Description                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `cd FOLDERPATH`       | Change into a directory           |
| `cd ..`               | Change into the parent directory  |
| `echo TEXT`           | Print TEXT to the terminal        |
| `echo TEXT > TARGET`  | Print TEXT to a file named TARGET |
| `echo TEXT >> TARGET` | Append TEXT to TARGET             |

| `mv SOURCE TARGET`    | Rename or move SOURCE to TARGET   |
| `python PYTHONFILE`   | Run PYTHONFILE                    |



Notes about paths

You can use cd with a relative path to navigate to a subfolder.
This is convenient because you don’t need to specify the full path from the root directory.
You can also change into any directory using a complete (absolute) path.


| Command | Description                                                                                |

| `sed`   | Used to edit text files, commonly to replace occurrences of words                          |
| `find`  | Locate files by name and identify specific files within a directory hierarchy              |



| Command                 | Description                                                       |

| `curl -O <url/to/file>` | Download a file using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP                         |
| `ssh <username>@<host>` | Establish an SSH connection to `<host>` with user `<username>`    |
| `ls -ld`                | Display the default permission for a home directory               |
| `ls -ld <dir>`          | Display read, write, and access permission of a particular folder |



Vim

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing text very efficient.
Key points:
Many text editors or word processors require the mouse to click menus or use key combinations like Ctrl + S to save a file.
In Vim, you can save a file without your hands leaving the keyboard, sometimes without even leaving the home keys.
From Vim’s insert mode, press:
Esc

IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code.
IDEs combine many developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI), making development more efficient and productive.
Examples of IDEs:
Eclipse
NetBeans
Visual Studio Code (great for front-end)
IntelliJ (best for Java)
Atom (very lightweight, good for simple tasks)


Common Features of an IDE

Source code editor
A text editor that helps write code with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and bug checking.
Local build automation
Tools to automate tasks like compiling code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
Debugger
A program that tests other programs and shows the location of bugs in the original code.
Code introspection
Tools to learn more about a function or class member.
Documentation features
Tools that help with documentation.
Language syntax tools
Tools to correct coding problems.


IDE vs Terminal

IDE and a terminal are both tools that programmers use.

IDE

Includes a code editor, compiler, and debugger, all via a graphical user interface (GUI).

Easier to spot and debug errors.

Easier to manage project files.

Terminal
Requires users to enter lines of code in a command-line interface to perform tasks
Usually faster than IDEs for executing tasks and commands.
Available on every machine, while IDEs may not be.
Common points
Both offer many customization options, such as themes, text colors, backgrounds, and shortcuts.
Best approach: Use the benefits of both IDEs and terminals depending on the project or task at hand.


Version Control

Version control (also called source control or revision control) is a software engineering practice that tracks and manages changes to files over time.
Benefits:
Help manage changes to files (especially source code) by taking snapshots as files are edited and saving them permanently.
Allows tracking of changes: Users can see the history of a file and roll back to previous versions if needed.
Identify and resolve conflicts: Makes visual file conflict management much easier.
Collaborate: Enables collaboration and code review.
Audit trail: Provides a full audit trail for every stage of the development cycle for all contributors.


Git

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) used for software development.
It is the modern standard for version control.
Used by many teams worldwide.


Features of Git

Distributed
Each developer has their own local copy of the repository, including the full history of the code.
This allows fast operations like merging, committing, and branching.
Branches
Developers can create copies of their source code (branches) and work on them in parallel to the main version.
Snapshots
Git takes a snapshot of every commit and compares it to previous versions (called a diff).
If there are changes, Git stores a new snapshot in the repository.
Flexibility
Git supports a wide range of workflows for different software teams.


Git vs GitHub

Both are used for managing code, but they have important differences:
Type
Git is a free, open-source version control tool installed locally.
GitHub is a cloud-based service that runs Git.
Purpose
Git tracks changes in files.
GitHub stores, shares, and helps collaborate on code.
Relationship
Git and GitHub work together, but you do not need GitHub to use Git.
Alternatives to GitHub
GitLab, Bitbucket, Gogs, Gitea.


Basic Git Commands
Create repositories
git init

Make changes
git add
git commit
git status

Parallel development
git branch
git merge
git rebase

Sync repositories
git push
git pull
git add origin
many others

What is Scripting?
-providing instructions to a computer so u can tell it what to do and to do it.
-or, code used to automate processes that would otherwise need to be executed step-by-step by developer. 
-Scripting language is a type of programming language that allows controlling one or more applications. 


Scripting vs Programming language
-A scripting language remains in its raw form until runtime, where it's submitted to a translator.
The translator interprets the commands one at a time,turning them into machine code that
can be used by the processor(CPU)
-Because scripting languages are not compiled in advance, they might not perform as well as conventional languages


Scripting VS Programming language 
-Scripting languages are dependent on other programs. You cannot use them to build independant applications 
like you can with conventional languages. 
-Scripting languages tend to provide less direct control over the hardware. With conventional language, programmers
can more easily manage processor, memory and input/output resources.
-Scripting languages are generally easier to work with than conventional programming languages.

BUT scripting languages and their tranlators have evolved over time, and the lines between
what should and what should not be classified as a scripting language have begun to blur. 
Today, many will say the classification is done by how the language is being used. 


How are scripting languages used?
-Scripting languages are often catrgorized as either server-side or client-side.
-Server-side scripting languages - such as PHP, Ruby and Python -- are processed on the host server
(where your app is, not visible to users).
-Clientside scripting languages - such as Javascript, Hypertext Markup Language and Cacading Style Sheets--
--are processed on the user's computer, typicallywithin a browser.

    - For this reason, websites often require users to configure their browsers to permit clinet-side scripts 
        to run. Otherwise, certain webpage features might not work.
    - They are used in multimedia and gaming, to automate tasks within applications, system administration, 
        reporting, statistics and etc. 


Examples of scripting languages
    -AppleScripts. A scripting language developed by Apple for building small programs called applets that
perform like bots. The applets can autom=nomously process and manage multimedia data, 
including digital video, text web content.
-Bourne shell. The original Unix shell, which is also known by its program name, sh.
-Bash.The free version of the Bourne shell distributed with Linux and GNU operating systems.
-C shell.Shell scripts and platform that was invented for programmers who prefer 
a syntax similiar to that of the C programming language.
-Javascript. Developed by Netscape. Shares similiar capabilities to those of Microsoft's Visual Basic,
 Unix-derived and IBM'S Rexx.

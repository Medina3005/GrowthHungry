Terminal

The Terminal is an app that lets you communicate with your operating system using a command-line interface (CLI).
You enter commands and scripts (called shell scripts) to perform tasks on your computer.

Two other terms that you might hear in combination with the terminal:

A shell is the program that you interact with when running commands in a terminal.

For Linux, it’s most likely Bash, for newer macOS versions it’s Zsh, and for Windows it’s PowerShell.
These shells differ in their features but share most of the basic commands.

A command - line interface (CLI) is a program designed to run in a shell inside the terminal.



Why Use Terminal?

Faster

To perform actions not supported by the operating system’s graphical user interface (GUI)

Automate repetitive tasks and create scripts to manage your development workflow (e.g., running tests or deploying apps)

Basic skill that software developers use daily

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and editing text efficient.

Many text editors require a mouse to save or navigate.

In Vim, you can edit and save files entirely from your keyboard.

From insert mode, press Esc then type :w to save your file.



❓ Why Vim?

If you’re not doing system administration or heavy text editing, you might not need to learn Vim.

However, over time, learning Vim can significantly boost productivity.



How Vim Works

Vim has three main modes:

Insert mode – for typing text.

Command mode – for executing commands like delete, move, etc.

Last-line mode – for saving or exiting.

When you open a file, Vim starts in command mode.
Typing letters doesn’t insert text — instead, keys act as commands (e.g., dd deletes a line).

To enter insert mode, type i. You can now type normally.

To return to command mode, press Esc.

To save or exit, type : to enter last-line mode, then use:

:w to save

:q to quit

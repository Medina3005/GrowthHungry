# Logic and Conditional Statements:
# - Introduction to Boolean values (True and False).
# - Using if, elif, and else statements to run different blocks of code based on a condition.
# - Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >) and logical operators (and, or, not).
# Project:
# Upgrade: Advanced Tip Calculator. Modify last week's Tip Calculator. Add a feature that asks how many people are splitting the bill and their names.
# The program should then calculate and display how much each person needs to pay.
# Add a condition: if the tip percentage is over 20%, print a "Thank you for your generosity!" message.+

# # Upper / Lower Case 

# mystring = "John Snow!"
# print(mystring.upper())   # will print all words in Upper case A

# mystring = "John Snow"
# print(mystring.startswith("John")) # will print true if it starts with John
# print(mystring.endswith("Alina")) # prints false if last words doesn't starts with Alina

# String Formatting

# print("%s is dating with Aigerim,  but likes Medina, who's %d years old. and %s  is %d years old" % (name, coworker, name1, coworker1))  
# # so you can put those initials, and print step by step. 


# mylist = [30, 50, 40]
# print("My school score is: %s" % (mylist))
#My school score is: [30, 50, 40] - > output will give as a number without square brackets. 

# Specifiers

# %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

# %d - Integers

# %f - floating point numbers

# %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot. 

# %x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)

# %x / %X â€” shows integers in hexadecimal (base-16) form. 


# data = ("Medina", "Alina", 55.65)
# format_string = "Good Afternoon"
# print(format_string % data)


number = 255
print("%x" % number)  # lowercase hex
print("%X" % number)  # uppercase hex

# Logic and Conditional Statements:
# - Introduction to Boolean values (True and False).
# - Using if, elif, and else statements to run different blocks of code based on a condition.
# - Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >) and logical operators (and, or, not).
# Project:
# Upgrade: Advanced Tip Calculator. Modify last week's Tip Calculator. Add a feature that asks how many people are splitting the bill and their names.
# The program should then calculate and display how much each person needs to pay.
# Add a condition: if the tip percentage is over 20%, print a "Thank you for your generosity!" message.



# Boolean Operators

# x = 2
# print(x == 2) #prints True
# print(x==3) Prints False
# print(x<3) prints True
# x = 2
# print(x!=2) False
# print (true == "true") False


# Boolean Operators  

# "and"  1 * 0 = 0, 1* 1 = 1
# and (True and False) = False
# and (False * False) = False 

# "or" 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 1 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0, 1 + 1 = 1
#         True or False = True
#         True and True = True
#         False or False = False 


# If Statment 

# if !(condition):  # negation if !(False) => will give True
# print("print your name")

# elif - it's a third option 

# 1 if - several elifs and one 1 else.  If it's a mandatory, elifs it's optional. If will not work without else.


# None - 0 - empty - string, dictionary will print always False

# print(not(2 == 2)) # print False 
# x = 2
# if not (x == 2):
#     print("this is not 2")
# else: print("this is 2")  # will print "this is 2"


# The "In" opeartor


# name = "fbcmr"
# if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
#     print("Your dina or alina")
# else: print("No such name")


# iterable object container 



# The "IS" Operator

# x == [1,2,3]
# y == [1,2,3]

# x is y -> False
# x == y -> True
# print(x == y)  #prints True
# print(x is y) #print False

# x = 2
# y == 2

# print(x is y)


# The "NOT" Operator

# print(not False)
# print((not False) == (False))

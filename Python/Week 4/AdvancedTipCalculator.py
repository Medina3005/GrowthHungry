# Project:
# Upgrade: Advanced Tip Calculator. Modify last week's Tip Calculator. Add a feature that asks how many people are splitting the bill and their names.
# The program should then calculate and display how much each person needs to pay.
# Add a condition: if the tip percentage is over 20%, print a "Thank you for your generosity!" message.



# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(name)

# total_amount = float(input("Enter total amount:"))
# print(total_amount)
# tip_percent = int(input("Please choose your tip %: "))
# print(tip_percent)


# tip = (total_amount * tip_percent) / 100
# total_bill = total_amount + tip
# total_bill = round(total_bill, 2)
# print("Your total bill amount is:", total_bill, "with", str(tip_percent) + "%", "tip:", tip)
